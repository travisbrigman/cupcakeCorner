/*
 There are two data types in this file. A struct title Order and a class titled Orders. The class acts as a wrapper around the Order struct. By seperating the two, we get the benefit of the Codable protocol in the struct, without having to create conformity by hand if we were to store data in the class. The class gives us the benefit of conforming to ObservableObject so that the instance can be created once and passed to the 3 different views in the app.
